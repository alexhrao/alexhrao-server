    <h1>ECE 6001: A Case Study in Class Failure</h1>
    <span class="subtitle">An exploration into what makes a class fail, and how it can be avoided</span>

      <div class="blurb">
        <p>I'm a Master's Student at Georgia Tech's School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) school, and before that I was an Undergraduate in Georgia Tech's ECE program. As a student, most of my criticism aimed at my classes is assumed to be misguided; unfortunately, that assumption has often been correct. Time and again I've realized that my complaints, however justified they felt at the time, were simply the product of a lack of vision and hindsight. Some of my "least favorite" classes, like System Architecture or Microelectronics, have since become my most treasured and valued experiences.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This class is different. This class is an abomination, a scar on the institution and on education in general. However, it perhaps can still serve a purpose: as a monument to why good class management is important, a reminder to other classes and students on how bad things can truly get. Feel free to disagree with me; I'm sure some of you maybe even enjoyed the course! But this post is it, it's my documentation on everything wrong with this course, why it's wrong, and what could be done instead. When applicable, I'll support my stance with evidence taken directly from the course page</p>

        <p>I don't consider myself an expert on class management; I'm not a professor, and frankly I've never wanted to be either. However, I have served as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for CS 1371, teaching MATLAB to thousands of GT students, and while the class certainly had issues of its own, it has given me a window into the behind-the-scenes work necessary to make sure a course runs smoothly.</p>
        <br>
        <p>It is my opinion that a good engineering class must strive to be or have all of the following; if you don't agree with me on these fundamentals, I seriously doubt we will agree on really anything:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="list-head">Vision</span>: If you're teaching a class, you'd better be ready to explain what you're trying to accomplish. This is often the syllabus; you should be able to list specific concepts, skills, and tools that the class will enable your students to use going forward. But more than that, you need to explain <em>why</em>; why should I take this class, what's the overall vision for why this course should exist?</li>
          <li><span class="list-head">Clear Expectations and Assessment Guidelines</span>: Your course should, from the start, have clear guidelines on how you will assess your students. This is more than just how many exams there will be; you should also explain <em>what</em> you are trying to assess. Assignments should clearly explain what a successful submission will look like; any ambiguity here will only serve to distract your students from your real learning objectives</li>
          <li><span class="list-head">Reasonable Workloads</span>: Your course needs to balance the work expectations of your students with the gains from this work. Too much workload, especially tedious and arguably unnecessary work, will have the opposite effect; your students will become disengaged and will likely do it "for the grade" instead of for the learning.</li>
          <li><span class="list-head">Assignment Reinforcement</span>: Any assignments should have a clear connection to the content in class; paying attention in lecture should serve as help for completing the assessments. Any disconnects leads to confusion and will likely cause low attendance and engagement during lecture</li>
          <li><span class="list-head">Well Organized</span>: Course resources should be simple to find, and be made easily available to all students. Any time spent <em>looking</em> for information is a massive distraction and can lead to frustration for students</li>
          <li><span class="list-head">Accurate Assessment</span>: Any assessment should serve to accurately determine how well a student can perform the core learning objectives; testing "gotchas" or minutiae that are not important to the course objectives will only frustrate and demoralize your students, without giving you a clearer picture of class understanding</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It is my opinion that ECE 6001 is an abject failure in all of these:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="list-head">Learning Objectvies</span>: The course</li>
          <li><span class="list-head">Clear Expectations and Assessment Guidelines</span>: Your course should, from the start, have clear guidelines on how you will assess your students. This is more than just how many exams there will be; you should also explain <em>what</em> you are trying to assess.
